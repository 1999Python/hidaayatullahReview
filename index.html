        Assalams Hidaayatullah,

        I've got to hand it to you, your work on our project is seriously impressive! ðŸ™Œ

        I couldn't help but admire how you've put together this code. Express, Express Handlebars, and pg-promise? You've got the tech stack down to a T! And the way you've structured everything, it's like you've got a roadmap in your head for the whole project.
        
        The user sessions, flash messages, and database connections are all seamless. I'm loving how you've taken care of the nitty-gritty details, like using environment variables for security. It's clear you've got a knack for this stuff.
        
        Your routes are like well-marked highways through our app, making it easy for anyone to follow. Whether it's logging in, signing up, or doing anything waiter or admin-related â€“ it's all smooth sailing.
        
        In a nutshell, your work has been awesome, and I'm genuinely proud of what we've accomplished together. If you're up for it, I am more than happy to assist you on some styling and making the project responsive.
        
        Keep up the fantastic work, Hidaayatullah ! ðŸš€
        
        Your work bestie,
        Raadiyah Arend
