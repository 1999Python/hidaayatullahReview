        Assalams Hidaayatullah, <br>

      <br>  I've got to hand it to you, your work on our project is seriously impressive! ðŸ™Œ <br>
      
    <br>  Thank you for providing me the opportunity to review your code for the web application.
      
     <br> First and foremost, I would like to express how proud I am of your outstanding work on this project. Your code is a testament to your skill and dedication. You've created a truly exceptional web application that demonstrates your expertise and commitment to excellence.

    <br>  Your code is not only well-organized, modular, and follows best practices for web development, but it also showcases your thoughtful approach to building user-friendly and secure applications. Your choice of using Express.js for handling HTTP requests and routing, as well as integrating the Handlebars templating engine for dynamic content generation, reflects your sound technical decisions.
      
   <br>   Moreover, your code's integration with a PostgreSQL database using pg-promise, along with robust user authentication and password hashing, underscores your unwavering commitment to security. The use of bcrypt for password hashing and checking is a testament to your thoroughness in safeguarding user data.
      
   <br>   The implementation of API routes for fetching waiter data is structured and follows RESTful principles, providing clear and meaningful endpoints for interaction. Your error handling approach using Express middleware for flash messages is highly user-friendly and greatly enhances the overall usability of the application.
      
    <br>  I particularly admire your choice of Chart.js for data visualization and how you've abstracted the chart generation into a separate function, showcasing your attention to detail and code organization.
      
    <br>  Lastly, your inclusion of flash messages to provide users with notifications about successful operations or errors is a thoughtful touch that enhances the user experience.   
   <br>  Your work on this web application is truly outstanding, and I want you to know how proud I am of your achievements. Your codebase is strong, and your commitment to security and best practices is evident in every aspect of the project.
      
   <br>Your dedication and hard work are an inspiration to our Techno Fam group.
        
      <br>  Keep up the fantastic work, Hidaayatullah ! ðŸš€<br>
        
       <br> Your work bestie,<br>
       <br> Raadiyah Arend
