            Assalams Hidaayatullah, <br>

            <br> I've got to hand it to you, your work on our project is seriously impressive! ðŸ™Œ <br>

            <br> Thank you for providing me the opportunity to review your code for the web application.

        <br>I want to say how impressed I am with your work on this project. Your code is really great, and it shows
            your skill and dedication. You've made an outstanding web application that proves your expertise and
            commitment to doing excellent work.

       <br> Your code is organized well, and it's easy to understand. You've followed the best practices for building
            websites, and it's clear that you've put a lot of thought into making it user-friendly and safe. I like how
            you used Express.js to handle web requests and routing, and how you've used Handlebars to create dynamic
            content. These were smart choices.

        <br> Also, your code works well with a PostgreSQL database using pg-promise, and you've done a good job with user
            authentication and password protection. The way you've secured user data with bcrypt is impressive. It's
            clear that you've taken security seriously.

        <br>I appreciate how you've set up the API routes for getting waiter data. It's well-organized and easy to use,
            following good principles for web services. I also like how you've used flash messages to give users
            feedback. It makes the application more user-friendly.

            <br> I want to highlight how you've used Chart.js for showing data visually. It's a nice touch, and I like
            how you've kept the code for creating charts separate and easy to understand.

            <br> Lastly, the use of flash messages to let users know when something goes right or wrong is a thoughtful
            addition that improves the user experience.

            <br>Your focus on security and best practices shines through in every
            part of the project.

            <br>Your dedication and hard work are an inspiration to our Techno Fam group.

            <br> Keep up the fantastic work, Hidaayatullah ! ðŸš€<br>

            <br> Your work bestie,<br>
            <br> Raadiyah Arend
